Opensource Production Steps for Safety Glasses

#How This Started

My friend Guus van Driel normally runs a custom furniture shop where he produces custom furniture for bars and restaurants. Due to Corona his business is almost at a standstill. So he decided to figure out what his business could contribute with the equipment and knowledge that his business already has. When he heard about the big shortages in protective gear for health care workers he decided to try and create a production method for safety glasses. The result in just 24 hours he was able to ship the first prototypes to a dutch hospital. 
With some refinement he's about to start small scale production (100 glasses per hour). When I heard about his story I suggested open sourcing the production process so anybody with the right equipment is able to start producing these for local hospitals and healthcare workers. 

#How to produce 

First check out the video he has produced documenting all the required steps.

Awareness: 
Distribute a leaflet to your local health authorities to let them know you can help them. 


Production:
1. Find a local machine shop with a laser cutter. 
2. Order 3mm thick plexiglass 
3. Start cutting the plexiglass using the cutting file from github [Cutting File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrazybernieNL/safetyglasses/master/safety%20glasses%20cut%20file.dxf) or from [Azure](https://coronaglasses.blob.core.windows.net/files/safetyglassescutfile.dxf)
4. Use a tablerouter to remove sharp edges from the cut plexiglass. 
5. Bend the acrylic. 
6. Cut straps.
7. Assemble the glasses.
